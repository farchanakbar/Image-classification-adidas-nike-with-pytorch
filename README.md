## About Dataset
This dataset can be used to build a CNN model that can classify if a shoe is an Adidas or Nike brand.

The images were pulled from bing using bing_image_search from pypi, 400 images of each class were downloaded and then the dataset was trimmed to 300(some unrelated images were removed in the process of compiling the dataset).
